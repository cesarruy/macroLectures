# Macroeconomic Analysis with R at Claremont Graduate University

The aim of this class is to equip you with a set of tools to analyze macroeconomic movements in the long and short-run. 
We will use macroeconomic data on incomes, prices, unemployment, interest rates, etc. to help model various pieces of the economy. We will begin by analyzing clasical theory in macroeconomics, to model long-run dynamics, then proceed to analyze new Keynesian models, to model short-run dyanmics. 
We will conclude by putting everything together and building models that capture both short and long-run dynamics.

Along the way we will learn how to program in the R statistical programming language. 
All of the files are generated in R-markdown files to allow you to see all of the code and lectures in one place.
